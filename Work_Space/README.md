This is the workspace readme file

The Database manipulation java project zip file holds a java project all about manipulating data within the database. It is testing ground for middleware functionality.

This project's goal is to create modular functions that can be pasted into a button's functionality within the GUI. The seperate project only uses a (Text User Interface) TUI create by the developer so there is no need to have a GUI interface for testing.
