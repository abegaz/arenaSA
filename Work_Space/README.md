This is the workspace readme file

This readme file will focus on the Database manipulation java project.

The purpose of this project is to contain and provide a work environment for the development of middleware functionality between the Arena program's GUI interface frontend and MySQL backend.

This helps test new iterations of the database as well as any created and modified java functions without the need for a GUI frontend.

It is my goal to create all middleware functionality within this project for other developers to use within their focused project fields.

The git folder should have everything needed to get started with. It comes with not only the most recent version of the database but also the previous version in case of any unforeseen consequences. 

Be wary: 
  The program comes with my own personal database credentials as well as the UNG school campus XAMPP default credentials.
  Please make sure to change those credentials to match your own database credentials.


Can anyone delete the Arena Subfolder within this git folder. I originally wanted to upload every file so if I made any changes i could just delete and replace those files. I learned later doing that was a terrible idea. I cannot for the life of me get the git program to work so uploading a zip file with all of the changes is the easiest thing for me to do.
