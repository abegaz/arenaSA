>>Title: Operator wants ability to create new games.
Story Points: Robert 14 days - Operators, in this case, are the actual program developers, creating new games depends on the complexity of said game. Simple games like tic-tac toe are easy to make when the player can only play against a random number generator. These games are reliant on a database to store and retrieve player moves and gamestates. If a single game can be created, connected to a database, and that two player can successfully play and complete the game, then we can focus on other aspects of the arena project. 
Assigned To: 
Description: As an Operator, I want the ability to create new games so that users can participate in matches within tournaments.
Acceptance Test(s):
• Operator can view game list of a given tournament.
• Operator can add game to game list of a given tournament.
• Operator can edit details of an existing game of a given tournament.
• Operator can remove game from game list of a given tournament.

>>Title: Operator wants ability to create new Tournaments.
Story Points: 
  Robert: 14 days - The time it would take to make a new tournament type would all depend on the complexity of the tournament.  These tournaments cannot be created dynamically within the program and must be custom made by the developers. Single elimination/ double emination tournaments would be relatively simple compared to Round-robin triple spilt tournament style. Creating every tournament style would be a daunting process and the time it will take to implement fully should not be under estimated. Tournaments should be prioirty number 1 after the database or until atleast 2 tournament styles are implemented. More can be added later. 
  
Assigned To: 
Description: As an Operator, I want the ability to create new tournament styles so that users can select from a broad variety of game types for there tournaments.

>>Title:  Operator wants ability to modify Expert Rating Formula
Story Points: 
  Robert: 4 days - Rating formula would be for tournamnets that don't rely on simple boolean logic. The ability to create new formula for a tournament should be a simple process. It could be as simple as inputting a string to the database or as complicated as making a new tournament style. The formula itself should not have priority until after a tournament that needs a rating forula has been implemented. The ability for an operator to implement the formula should be created with the operator's administrative abilities.
Assigned To: 
Description: As an Operator, I want the ability to modify the Expert Rating Formula, so that I can modify the criteria for which ER Points are earned and to insure cheating is midigated.

>>Title: Operator wants ability to manage users.
Story Points: 
  Robert: 6 days - This should be as simple as accessing the database and editing the database from the program itself. This should be implement naturally as the project is developed. The operator having the ability to access the database should be one of, if not the first thing, that is implemented.
