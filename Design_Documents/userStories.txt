[Arena’s hold Leagues.  Leagues Have Tournaments. Tournaments have matches (games). ]

[As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.]
I think we should make a clearer distinction between the operator and the league owner. Given that this is a for-profit business the operator is the CEO/manager. It is his responsibility to oversee the league owners, advertisers and all financial matters. On the other hand, the league owner should be responsible for developing new games and for their administration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>Title: Operator wants ability to create new games.
Story Points: 
	Robert: 14 days - Operators, in this case, are the actual program developers, creating new games depends on the complexity of said game. Simple games like 			tic-tac toe are easy to make when the player can only play against a random number generator. These games are reliant on a database to store and 			retrieve player moves and gamestates. If a single game can be created, connected to a database, and that two player can successfully play and complete 			the game, then we can focus on other aspects of the arena project.
	Bren: 	14 days  
	Mark: 16 days I'm not really sure how this is going to work unless we have something that is a mock-up.  
	Kyle:  14-? days
 
Assigned To: 
Description: As an Operator, I want the ability to create new games so that users can participate in matches within tournaments.
Acceptance Test(s):
• Operator can view game list of a given tournament.
• Operator can add game to game list of a given tournament.
• Operator can edit details of an existing game of a given tournament.
• Operator can remove game from game list of a given tournament.

>>Title: Operator wants ability to create new Tournaments.
Story Points: 
	Robert: 14 days - The time it would take to make a new tournament type would all depend on the complexity of the tournament.  These tournaments cannot be 			created dynamically within the program and must be custom made by the developers. Single elimination/ double emination tournaments would be relatively 			simple 	compared to Round-robin triple spilt tournament style. Creating every tournament style would be a daunting process and the time it will take to 		implement fully 	should not be under estimated. Tournaments should be prioirty number 1 after the database or until atleast 2 tournament styles 			are implemented. More can be 	added later. 
	Bren:   7 days. This seems like it would be pretty easy to set up once we have game creation set up. Really depends on how we want to rank players and the
		amount of variables that come with what type of game/tournament is used.
	Mark:	11 days. 	
	Kyle:  12-14 days
  
Assigned To: 
Description: As an Operator, I want the ability to create new tournament styles so that users can select from a broad variety of game types for there tournaments.

• Operator can edit existing Tournament style.
• Operator can remove Tournament from list of existing Tournaments. 

>>Title:  Operator wants ability to modify Expert Rating Formula
Story Points: 
	Robert: 4 days - Rating formula would be for tournamnets that don't rely on simple boolean logic. The ability to create new formula for a tournament should be 			a simple process. It could be as simple as inputting a string to the database or as complicated as making a new tournament style. The formula itself 			should not have priority until after a tournament that needs a rating formula has been implemented. The ability for an operator to implement the 			formula should be created with the operator's administrative abilities.
	Bren Bailey: 5 days.
	Mark:	4 days. -Should be simple enough to set up a way for the league owner to determine the number of entrants, the amount of points for each place, and having the program check the placement and add the number of points to the Database.
Assigned To: 
Description: As an Operator, I want the ability to modify the Expert Rating Formula, so that I can modify the criteria for which ER Points are earned and to insure cheating is mitigated.
	Kyle:  4 days
Acceptance Test(s):

• Operator can pick which variables are used in Expert Rating Formula
• Operator can add new variable to list of variables for potential use in Expert Rating Formula. 

>>Title: Operator wants ability to manage users.
Story Points: 
	Robert: 6 days - This should be as simple as accessing the database and editing the database from the program itself. This should be implement naturally as the 		project is developed. The operator having the ability to access the database should be one of, if not the first thing, that is implemented.
	Bren:   7 days.
	Mark:	9 days. - Mostly because I'm just now learning Databases and don't have as much skills with it
	Kyle:  7 days
