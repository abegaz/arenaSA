ARENA: A Functional View

ARENA is a business. As such it requires a business plan that demonstrates it objectives and plans to reach those objectives.  Ideally, in the real world, we as a development team would meet as often as necessary with ALL the stakeholders – Manager, League Owners, Players, Spectators, Advertisers and Game developers to determine their requirements. Unfortunately, we are unable to do this in our hypothetical setting so we must also act as stakeholders as well as be the development team.

The all-encompassing entity is the ARENA. Within the ARENA are any numbers of Leagues. Leagues can host any number of tournaments each consisting of any number of games depending on the tournament and game style and number of participants. I think we should make a clearer distinction between the operator and the league owner. Given that this is a for-profit business the operator is the CEO/manager(Commissioner if you want to use MLB, NFL metaphor). It is his responsibility to oversee the league owners, advertisers and all financial matters. On the other hand, the league owner should be responsible for developing new games and for their administration.
