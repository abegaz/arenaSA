arenaPrototype
 
Meant to serve as refrence for Developers.

Delete any previous Prototype version & any previous 'arena' databases before
implementing this version.

* Requires User To : 
 --  Create Database 'arena' . 
 --  In XAMP LocalHost 'root' password must be set to 'zilbot46'
 --  Default database is NOT populated. You must Add Users. (( Use the program itself or enter the data into the table ))

* Uses additional libraries:
These must be downloaded and manually added to library in order to run the program properly in Eclipse.
